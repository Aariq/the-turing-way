# Barriers to reproducibility

So far we have described the [importance](../01/importantforscience) of reproducible research and motivated why we think [you should care](../02/whycare).

But there are many barriers to reproducible research.
You can watch Kirstie Whitaker describe some of them in [her talk about The Turing Way](https://youtu.be/wZeoZaIV0VE?t=312) at [csv,conf,v4](https://csvconf.com/2019) in May 2019.
The section describing the slide below starts around 5 minutes into the video.

|  Some of the barriers to reproducible research. |

This chapter outlines some of those barriers, and a couple of suggestions to get around them.

## Plead the fifth 

No-one wants to incriminate themselves, and no-one is infallible. Putting your code online can be very revealing and intimidating, and people are scared of being judged by others. However, releasing code can help other researchers provide feedback, learn and may help them in their research. Publishing your code encourages you to write your code to a high standard and can help generate new ideas. **Let the person who is without bugs report the first error.**
