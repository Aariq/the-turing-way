### Bio 

> Camila is a Research Data Scientist at The Alan Turing Institute. She holds a PhD in Particle Physics from Université Paris Diderot where she worked on the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. 
> During her PhD she participated on the discovery of the Higgs Boson particle announced by CERN in 2012. 
> She continued working on ATLAS as a postdoc with Uppsala University where she focused on searches for physics beyond the Standard Model of Particle Physics.

> Right before joining the Turing Institute, she worked on technical ways to improve how we assess learners and what they learned. 

## Current work

Currently I’m working in collaboration with researchers from the Global Systems Institute at University of Exeter called Data science for Sustainable Development. 
In this project we are using remote sensing to monitor the resilience of patterned vegetation from semi-arid dryland ecosystems in the Sahel. 
Resilience is a measure of the rate at which a system recovers from perturbations back to its original state. 
For systems that can approach a tipping point (where their current state loses stability and they transition to an alternative state), this is heralded by early warning signals of declining resilience that can be measured. 
We measure resilience with quantitative methods to characterise the morphology of spatial patterns applied to satellite images of patterned vegetation obtained using the Google Earth Engine platform.
It is a fascinating interdisciplinary project that involves ecology, remote sensing and software engineering.  
 
## Other involvements in improving accessibility in Data Science
 
I’m from Venezuela, and although I have done most of my career in Europe I’ve been always keen to stay connected to the academic and scientific wold back in Latin-America. 
I’m the co-founder of the CEVALE2VE project (http://www.cevale2ve.org/en/home/), which of a virtual learning community that aims to tackle the serious issue of brain-drain in some Latin-American countries by bringing back the knowledge in a digital/online platform. 
More recently that project has become consolidated into LA-CoNGA physics (http://laconga.redclara.net/), an EU Erasmus+ funded project with a mission to create a Latin American and European Community for Advanced Physics.
This effort aims to support the modernization of the higher education system in the region and to promote values of collaboration, education and open research. 
In this project I’m helping to build a data science module that will be thought in an online master course.

## Her ongoing involvement in _The Turing Way_ community
 
I think The Turing Way is an excellent resource that can change the way science is done (I wish I had it when I started my PhD!). 
Although the international language of science is English, I know for a fact that not everyone in places like Latin-American have the time and resources to learn it, so I think we must do everything we can to break those barriers and improve the accessibility of knowledge for everyone. 
This is my motivation to translate the book to Spanish, and I hope that the Spanish version will be used as an important resource on the master course we are developing for a project (the LA-CoNGA physics project).
