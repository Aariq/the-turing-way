### Bio 

Heidi is a medical AI researcher, research software engineer and open science expert at LMU Munich, Bielefeld University and the Helmholtz Zentrum Munich.
She develops machine learning methods to figure out which patients react well to certain treatments and implements these methods in R.
Her passion for open and reproducible research has lead her to join the Turing Way community.


## Current work

Currently I am spending most of my time on improving the way we do research.
I am involved in meta-research projects (research about research), I support, teach and contribute to open projects such as The Turing Way.

My work for the *Journal of Statistical Software* includes reproducibility checks. We only publish papers which are fully computationally reproducible.

I also work on making our machine-learning software more user-friendly, reusable and extensible. 
Together with a PhD student I am thinking about how to
use data from hospitals to help doctors and patients find the right treatment
for each individual patient.

I try to continue learning.
Currently I am learning how to use agile project management methods (Scrum) in a scientific setting.

## Heidi's ongoing involvement in _The Turing Way_ community

I am really excited to be a member of this great community. 
The book is such a great ressource!

Currently I am trying to add information which I think is still lacking.
Also I try to support reviews of other content.

Long term I would like to create an online course on reproducible data science with the Turing Way as a basis.
