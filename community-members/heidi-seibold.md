## Personas of the contributing members of _The Turing Way_

* Name: **Heidi Seibold**

* Date: 02 June 2020
* Current involvement: Creating new chapter, reviewing, developing ideas for an online course based on The Turing Way

### Bio 

Heidi is a medical AI researcher, research software engineer and open science expert at LMU Munich, Bielefeld University and the Helmholtz Zentrum Munich.
She develops machine learning methods to figure out which patients react well to certain treatments and implements these methods in R.
Her passion for open and reproducible research has lead her to join the Turing Way community.


## Current work

Currently I am spending most of my time on improving the way we do research.
I am involved in meta-research projects (research about research), I support, teach and contribute to open projects such as The Turing Way.

My work for the *Journal of Statistical Software* includes reproducibility checks. We only publish papers which are fully computationally reproducible.

I also work on making our machine-learning software more user-friendly, reusable and extensible. 
Together with a PhD student I am thinking about how to
use data from hospitals to help doctors and patients find the right treatment
for each individual patient.

I try to continue learning.
Currently I am learning how to use agile project management methods (Scrum) in a scientific setting.


## How did you get involved in The Turing Way and what motivated you to work on your current contributions?

I don't actually know how I learned about The Turing Way initially, but many of
my contacts in the open science and Mozilla networks were somewhat involved or
tweeted about it.

After passively following the activities for a while I wanted to get involved.

Why? Well, I work in data science and open and reproducible research are the things I think and
care about the most. So to me it only made sense to get involved. Plus: the community seemed 
amazing!


## What impact has The Turing Way had on you, your work, or your network?

To me The Turing Way is a role model when it comes to colloaborative,
distributed work. I learned so much just by participating in the book sprint
and seeing how Malvika, Kirstie and everyone else contributed to providing an
extremely welcoming and at the same time productive space. I took what
I learned and tried to apply it in other contexts such as teaching. I will 
continue to do so.

The Turing Way also inspired me to think about new ways we could teach people
about open and reproducible (data) science. I am currently thinking a lot about
how we could use the content from The Turing Way and turn it into a course. 
This idea was also part of an application, where I proposed to start a new 
group on *Open AI*. 
<!---
Might be nice to add the outcome of that application at some point ;)

I regularly recommend The Turing Way as a ressource. Both for learning more
about reproducible data science and also when discussing specific topics.
I think that people are taking it on and reading it :)



## What impact you would like to create with your work in The Turing Way?

First, I would like to continue to help create content, review others content
and be helpful in any way I can. Sometimes I like to look at really old issues
and pull requests for example. Reviving such old, often almost finished bits,
is very rewarding.

Apart from that I also have a bigger, long term idea for The Turing Way.
I personally am not a huge fan of reading. So books are not my favorite way to
learn.  In the past years I learned a lot by listening to others in talks,
podcasts, videos, and of course conversations.  So for me it is only a natural
next step for The Turing Way to become more than a book. It could be an
ecosystem, with the book at its basis. And -- if we decide to go that route --
I would like to be a part of it.

### What would be the steps?

- Extend and update the Turing Way book.
- Create slide material and test in in-person workshops and presentations.
- Create videos and make them available.
- Build online quizzes and programming exercises.
- Combine all material into an online course.
- Teach course as flipped classroom course.
- Teach course as MOOC.

Some of these steps are already being taken and have been taken for a while.  I
assume that many people have used The Turing Way as a basis for teaching
material such as slides.
